  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
    HTML woke up today and chose structure.
    Headings are feeling important, paragraphs are doing their best,
    and divs are holding everything together with pure optimism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classes are trying to be stylish, IDs insist on being unique,
    and semantic tags quietly judge you for using too many <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s.
    The browser smiles, renders the page, and pretends nothing is broken.
